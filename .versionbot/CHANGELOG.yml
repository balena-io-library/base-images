                Mentioning that this is a 4GB RAM Orin Nano module in the name.

                The carrier board appears to be very close to the Devkit, so
                this

                image may be used with other carrier boards if they are
                compatible.

      hash: d44373db2378be5c6c0e1a8bcdfbc58e7ddae938
      body: |
        Use the workflow run event to trigger listening
        jobs rather than calling them directly.

        Use the same concurrency group for all bake workflows,
        allowing for cancellation of all jobs in progress without
        starting new ones.

    - subject: Add a schedule to trigger os-arch and stack-arch jobs
      hash: 1c2a72be8db84c0015ab1e0e760a1386d911ff6c
      body: |
        Use concurrency group settings to ensure that only
        one bake workflow, no matter the device type or arch,
        can be running at a single time. The rest will be queued
        by default, with a manual option to cancel in-progress.

        Since each workflow can generate 100s of jobs once
        the matrices are expanded, we need this concurrency
        limit to remain within the 500 concurrent runner
        maximum allowed by our enterprise plan.

      hash: 2e7bdf3826f250ea9c2298740f7b96cef3a81ff2
      body: |
        This creates a much more managable list of
        workflows, at the cost of reducing the granularity
        of dependency triggers.

        In this configuration, all related os-arch and stack-arch
        combinations will need to complete before triggering
        any of the downstream os-device and stack-device jobs.

                which use quoted links, like for example the CM4.

        This is an easier separation of workflows and allows
        better dependency handling so alpine device images aren't
        waiting on ubuntu arch images.

        We can always switch back to arch/device specific workflows
        if we are hitting the limit supported by GitHub.

        Renovate is one of the few apps with permissions to update
        workflow files, so it is best suited to generate all workflows
        as a postUpgradeCommand.

        These jobs were only added to PRs for testing, but it tends

      body: |
        GitHub actions build matrices are limited to 256 jobs
        so we can't have over 2k jobs in one workflow.

        Instead, create a new github workflow for every base library
        and create a matrix for each active tag variant.

        This should allow infinite scaling of devices rather
        than single workflows that are limited in length, and matrix size.

        This reverts commit 89afe302fa99497322d91a90373ee734e1c1279f.

        The pre-commit is being called during automated workflows
        and fails to commit the resulting files due to lack of permissions.

      body: |
        Use self-hosted runners to generate and merge changes to
        Dockerfiles and Libaries on finalize.

        On open PR tests, the files will be generated but discarded
        as the commit hash from master is used in the generation
        of library files.

        The above is only for testing, and to slow
        the rate of PR merges to master to allow time for previous merge
        actions to complete generating.

      body: >
        We only want to generate Dockerfiles for the canonical device type

        names and not their aliases. Ex. There is a
        `raspberry-pi2-alpine-python` image

        but not a `raspberrypi2-alpine-python` image. This removes the aliases

        before building the contract to prevent the universe reproduction to

        generate combinations for those aliases as well.

      body: |
        Remove generate-stackbrew-library.sh script and helpers
        under scripts/stackbrew-library. These don't seem to serve a purpose
        anymore as they have been replaced by the node scripts.

        The balena-supervisor-base images have not been used for a while by the
        supervisor dockerfile. This removes the contract and related scripts to
        avoid generating images that won't be used.
