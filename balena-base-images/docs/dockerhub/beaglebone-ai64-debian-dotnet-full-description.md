This image is part of the [balena.io][balena] base image series for IoT devices. The image is optimized for use with [balena.io][balena] and [balenaOS][balena-os], but can be used in any Docker environment running on the appropriate architecture.

Some notable features in `balenalib` base images:

- Helpful package installer script called `install_packages` that abstracts away the specifics of the underlying package managers. It will install the named packages with smallest number of dependencies (ignore optional dependencies), clean up the package manager medata and retry if package install fails.

- Working with dynamically plugged devices: each `balenalib` base image has a default `ENTRYPOINT` which is defined as `ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/entry.sh"]`, it checks if the `UDEV` flag is set to true or not (by adding `ENV UDEV=1`) and if true, it will start `udevd` daemon and the relevant device nodes in the container /dev will appear.

For more details, please check the [features overview](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/base-images/base-images/#features-overview) in our documentation.

# [Image Variants][variants]

The `balenalib` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `:<version>` or `:<version>-run`

This is the defacto image. The `run` variant is designed to be a slim and minimal variant with only runtime essentials packaged into it.

## `:<version>-build`

The build variant is a heavier image that includes many of the tools required for building from source. This reduces the number of packages that you will need to manually install in your Dockerfile, thus reducing the overall size of all images on your system.

# About This Repository

This repository contains different flavours of .NET Core platform: .NET Core SDK, ASP.NET Core Runtime and .NET Core Runtime.

- .NET Core Runtime contains runtimes and libraries and is optimized for running .NET Core apps in production.

- ASP.NET Core Runtime contains ASP.NET Core and .NET Core runtimes and libraries and is optimized for running ASP.NET Core apps in production.

- .NET Core SDK is comprised of three parts: .NET Core CLI, .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. Use this variant for your development process (developing, building and testing applications).

## About .NET Core

[.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/) is a general purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core). It is cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux, and can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.

.NET has several capabilities that make development easier, including a utomatic memory management, (runtime) generic types, reflection, asynchrony, concurrency, and native interop. Millions of developers take advantage of these capabilities to efficiently build high-quality applications.

You can use C# to write .NET Core apps. C# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages. Anyone familiar with C and similar languages will find it straightforward to write in C#.

[.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) is open source (MIT and Apache 2 licenses) and was contributed to the [.NET Foundation](http://dotnetfoundation.org) by Microsoft in 2014. It can be freely adopted by individuals and companies, including for personal, academic or commercial purposes. Multiple companies use .NET Core as part of apps, tools, new platforms and hosting services.

You are invited to [contribute new features](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.

[&#x60;7.0-sdk&#x60;, &#x60;7.0-runtime&#x60;, &#x60;7.0-aspnet&#x60;, &#x60;6.0-sdk&#x60;, &#x60;6.0-runtime&#x60;, &#x60;6.0-aspnet&#x60;](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/balena-base-images/dotnet/beaglebone-ai64/debian/)

For more information about this image and its history, please see the [relevant manifest file (`beaglebone-ai64-debian-dotnet`)](https://github.com/balena-io-library/official-images/blob/master/library/beaglebone-ai64-debian-dotnet) in the [`balena-io-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/balena-io-library/official-images).

# How to use this image

### Create a `Dockerfile` in your dotnet app project

```dockerfile
# specify the dotnet base image with your desired version dotnet:<version>
FROM balenalib/beaglebone-ai64-debian-dotnet:latest
# replace this with your application's default port
EXPOSE 8000
```

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t my-dotnet-app .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-dotnet-app
```

If you prefer Docker Compose:

```yml
version: "2"
services:
  dotnet:
    image: "balenalib/beaglebone-ai64-debian-dotnet:latest"
    user: "dotnet"
    working_dir: /home/dotnet/app
    volumes:
      - ./:/home/dotnet/app
    expose:
      - "8000"
```

You can then run using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```
