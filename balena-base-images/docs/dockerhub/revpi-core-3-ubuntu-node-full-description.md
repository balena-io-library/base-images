This image is part of the [balena.io][balena] base image series for IoT devices. The image is optimized for use with [balena.io][balena] and [balenaOS][balena-os], but can be used in any Docker environment running on the appropriate architecture.

Some notable features in `balenalib` base images:

- Helpful package installer script called `install_packages` that abstracts away the specifics of the underlying package managers. It will install the named packages with smallest number of dependencies (ignore optional dependencies), clean up the package manager medata and retry if package install fails.

- Working with dynamically plugged devices: each `balenalib` base image has a default `ENTRYPOINT` which is defined as `ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/entry.sh"]`, it checks if the `UDEV` flag is set to true or not (by adding `ENV UDEV=1`) and if true, it will start `udevd` daemon and the relevant device nodes in the container /dev will appear.

For more details, please check the [features overview](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/base-images/base-images/#features-overview) in our documentation.

# [Image Variants][variants]

The `balenalib` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `:<version>` or `:<version>-run`

This is the defacto image. The `run` variant is designed to be a slim and minimal variant with only runtime essentials packaged into it.

## `:<version>-build`

The build variant is a heavier image that includes many of the tools required for building from source. This reduces the number of packages that you will need to manually install in your Dockerfile, thus reducing the overall size of all images on your system.

# How to use this image with Balena

This [guide][getting-started] can help you get started with using this base image with balena, there are also some cool [example projects][example-projects] that will give you an idea what can be done with balena.

# What is Node.js?

Node.js is a software platform for scalable server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux without changes.

Node.js applications are designed to maximize throughput and efficiency, using non-blocking I/O and asynchronous events. Node.js applications run single-threaded, although Node.js uses multiple threads for file and network events. Node.js is commonly used for real-time applications due to its asynchronous nature.

Node.js internally uses the Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute code; a large percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript. Node.js contains a built-in, asynchronous I/O library for file, socket, and HTTP communication. The HTTP and socket support allows Node.js to act as a web server without additional software such as Apache.

# Supported versions and respective `Dockerfile` links :

[&#x60;15.10.0 (latest)&#x60;, &#x60;14.16.0&#x60;, &#x60;12.21.0&#x60;, &#x60;10.24.0&#x60;](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/balena-base-images/node/revpi-core-3/ubuntu/)

For more information about this image and its history, please see the [relevant manifest file (`revpi-core-3-ubuntu-node`)](https://github.com/balena-io-library/official-images/blob/master/library/revpi-core-3-ubuntu-node) in the [`balena-io-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/balena-io-library/official-images).

# How to use this image

### Create a `Dockerfile` in your Node.js app project

```dockerfile
# specify the node base image with your desired version node:<version>
FROM balenalib/revpi-core-3-ubuntu-node:latest
# replace this with your application's default port
EXPOSE 8888
```

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t my-nodejs-app .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-nodejs-app
```

If you prefer Docker Compose:

```yml
version: "2"
services:
  node:
    image: "balenalib/revpi-core-3-ubuntu-node:latest"
    user: "node"
    working_dir: /home/node/app
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    volumes:
      - ./:/home/node/app
    expose:
      - "8081"
    command: "npm start"
```

You can then run using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Docker Compose example copies your current directory (including node_modules) to the container.
It assumes that your application has a file named [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)
defining [start script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#default-values).

### Run a single Node.js script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a
complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a Node.js script by using the
Node.js Docker image directly:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app balenalib/revpi-core-3-ubuntu-node:latest node your-daemon-or-script.js
```
