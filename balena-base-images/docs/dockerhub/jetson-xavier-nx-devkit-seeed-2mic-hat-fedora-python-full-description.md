This image is part of the [balena.io][balena] base image series for IoT devices. The image is optimized for use with [balena.io][balena] and [balenaOS][balena-os], but can be used in any Docker environment running on the appropriate architecture.

Some notable features in `balenalib` base images:

- Helpful package installer script called `install_packages` that abstracts away the specifics of the underlying package managers. It will install the named packages with smallest number of dependencies (ignore optional dependencies), clean up the package manager medata and retry if package install fails.

- Working with dynamically plugged devices: each `balenalib` base image has a default `ENTRYPOINT` which is defined as `ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/entry.sh"]`, it checks if the `UDEV` flag is set to true or not (by adding `ENV UDEV=1`) and if true, it will start `udevd` daemon and the relevant device nodes in the container /dev will appear.

For more details, please check the [features overview](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/base-images/base-images/#features-overview) in our documentation.

# [Image Variants][variants]

The `balenalib` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `:<version>` or `:<version>-run`

This is the defacto image. The `run` variant is designed to be a slim and minimal variant with only runtime essentials packaged into it.

## `:<version>-build`

The build variant is a heavier image that includes many of the tools required for building from source. This reduces the number of packages that you will need to manually install in your Dockerfile, thus reducing the overall size of all images on your system.

# How to use this image with Balena

This [guide][getting-started] can help you get started with using this base image with balena, there are also some cool [example projects][example-projects] that will give you an idea what can be done with balena.

# What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, open-source programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later.

# Supported versions and respective `Dockerfile` links :

[&#x60;3.11.2 (latest)&#x60;, &#x60;3.10.10&#x60;, &#x60;3.9.16&#x60;, &#x60;3.8.16&#x60;](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/balena-base-images/python/jetson-xavier-nx-devkit-seeed-2mic-hat/fedora/)

For more information about this image and its history, please see the [relevant manifest file (`jetson-xavier-nx-devkit-seeed-2mic-hat-fedora-python`)](https://github.com/balena-io-library/official-images/blob/master/library/jetson-xavier-nx-devkit-seeed-2mic-hat-fedora-python) in the [`balena-io-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/balena-io-library/official-images).

# How to use this image

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Python app project

```dockerfile
FROM balenalib/jetson-xavier-nx-devkit-seeed-2mic-hat-fedora-python:latest

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "./your-daemon-or-script.py" ]
```

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t my-python-app .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-python-app
```

## Run a single Python script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a Python script by using the Python Docker image directly:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp balenalib/jetson-xavier-nx-devkit-seeed-2mic-hat-fedora-python:latest python your-daemon-or-script.py
```
